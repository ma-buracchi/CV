		\ecvitem {Bio}{In September 2012 I decided to enroll myself at the University of Florence to pursue my true passion; computer science and cybersecurity. I graduated in October 2018 with 110/110 cum laude at the master's degree in resilient and secure cyber physical systems. My master thesis was on \emph{"Side-Channel Attacks and speculative execution"}. Before, I obtained the bachelor degree in computer science in 2015 with 110/110 cum laude. Next year I will attend a first-level professional master in Cybersecurity provided by University of Pisa. From November 2018 I'm private tutor at Centro Didattico Matemagia in Florence.}
